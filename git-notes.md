## Commit Message

5 steps to write better commit message:

- 1. Capitalization and Punctuation: Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using Conventional Commits, remember to use all lowercase.

- 2. Mood: Use imperative mood in the subject line. Example – Add fix for dark mode toggle state. Imperative mood gives the tone you are giving an order or request.

- 3. Type of Commit: Specify the type of commit. It is recommended and can be even more beneficial to have a consistent set of words to describe your changes. Example: Bugfix, Update, Refactor, Bump, and so on. See the section on Conventional Commits below for additional information.

- 4. Length: The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters, and the body should be restricted to 72 characters.

- 5. Content: Be direct, try to eliminate filler words and phrases in these sentences (examples: though, maybe, I think, kind of). Think like a journalist.

The commit type can include the following:

- `feat` - a new feature is introduced with the changes

- `fix` - a bug fix has occurred

- `chore` - changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)

- `refactor` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

- `docs` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files

- `style` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.

- `test` – including new or correcting previous tests

- `perf` – performance improvements

- `ci` – continuous integration related

- `build` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

- `revert` – reverts a previous commit
